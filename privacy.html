---

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We process your personal data for the following purposes, each with a lawful basis under the NDPA 2023:

| Purpose | Lawful Basis |
|---------|-------------|
| Creating and managing your account | Performance of contract |
| Operating the Witness to Sale™ attribution system | Performance of contract; Legitimate interest |
| Matching buyers with properties and creators with opportunities | Performance of contract |

## 4. Attribution Cookies and Tracking

### 4.1 How Attribution Works

MREN uses cookies and similar technologies to operate its core attribution system — the mechanism that ensures Content Creators and Realtors are credited when their marketing efforts contribute to a property sale.

| Cookie | Purpose | Duration |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Attribution Cookie** | Records which Creator's content and which Realtor's tracking link a buyer interacted with | 60 days |
| **Session Cookie** | Maintains your login state | Session (cleared on browser close) |
| **Preference Cookie** | Stores your display preferences (theme, language) | 12 months |

### 4.2 Attribution Data Retention

Attribution data captured through cookies is stored in our database for a maximum of 365 days (the "Ledger Lock" period) from the date of the buyer's first interaction. This retention period is necessary to accurately attribute sales that may close months after initial engagement, which is common in Nigerian real estate transactions.

After the 365-day Ledger Lock expires, attribution data is anonymized and retained only for aggregate analytics purposes.

### 4.3 Your Cookie Choices

You may manage cookie preferences through your browser settings. However, disabling attribution cookies will prevent the Platform from tracking sales attribution, which may affect Creators' and Realtors' ability to earn commissions from your interactions.

Essential cookies required for Platform security and functionality cannot be disabled while using the Platform.

## 5. How We Share Your Information

We do not sell your personal data. We share information only in the following circumstances:

| Recipient | Data Shared | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Property Developers** | Buyer inquiry details (name, contact, property interest) | To facilitate property sales and buyer communication |
| **Creators and Realtors** | Anonymized lead counts, attribution confirmations (no buyer personal details) | Commission tracking and performance reporting |
| **Platform Administrators** | All platform data as necessary | Verification, dispute resolution, compliance |
| **Service Providers** | Data necessary for the service (hosting, email delivery, payment processing) | Platform operations |
| **Legal Authorities** | Data as required by law, court order, or government request | Legal compliance |

### 5.1 Commission Data Visibility

Commission pool percentages, commission amounts, and payout details are visible only to the Property Developer who set them, the Creator and Realtor attributed to a sale, and Platform Administrators. Commission data is never displayed to Buyers or the general public.

### 5.2 Witness to Sale™ Records

Witness to Sale™ records are immutable attribution records that document who contributed to a property sale. These records contain attribution data (Creator ID, Realtor ID, property details, sale confirmation date) but do not contain buyer financial details or sensitive personal information. They may be shared with parties to a commission dispute as part of our dispute resolution process.

## 6. Data Storage and Security

### 6.1 Where We Store Data

Your data is stored on secure cloud infrastructure provided by Supabase (hosted on Amazon Web Services). Our primary data servers are located in regions that comply with international data protection standards. Where data is transferred outside Nigeria, we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place as required by the NDPA 2023.

### 6.2 Security Measures

We implement industry-standard security measures including:

- Encryption of data in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256)
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies ensuring role-based data access
- Encrypted password storage using bcrypt hashing
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments
- Access controls limiting employee access to personal data on a need-to-know basis
- Audit logging of all administrative actions affecting user data or Witness records

### 6.3 Data Breach Response

In the event of a personal data breach that poses a risk to your rights, we will notify the Nigeria Data Protection Commission (NDPC) within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach, and will notify affected individuals without undue delay as required by the NDPA 2023.

## 7. Data Retention
