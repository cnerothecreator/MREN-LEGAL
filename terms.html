## 2. Platform Overview

### 2.1 What MREN Is

MREN is a witness-driven real estate attribution platform that connects Property Developers, Content Creators, Realtors, and Buyers within an ecosystem designed to track, verify, and reward marketing contributions to property sales in Nigeria. The Platform operates the proprietary Witness to Sale™ attribution system.

### 2.2 What MREN Is Not

| MREN Is Not | Clarification |
|-------------|---------------|
| A real estate brokerage | MREN is an attribution and commission orchestration platform, not a licensed brokerage |
| A financial institution | MREN records commission entitlements; actual fund transfers occur through external banking channels |
| A property valuation service | MREN does not appraise, value, or guarantee the worth of any listed property |
| A legal advisor | MREN does not provide legal advice regarding property transactions, title verification, or contractual matters |
| A video hosting platform | All video content is hosted on third-party platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram); MREN stores links only |
| A guarantor of transactions | MREN facilitates connections and records attribution but does not guarantee the completion or outcome of any property transaction |

- All property information, descriptions, images, and pricing you provide are accurate and not misleading

## 5. The Witness to Sale™ System

### 5.1 How Attribution Works

The Witness to Sale™ system tracks the chain of influence from content creation through distribution to buyer inquiry and sale confirmation. When a buyer's purchase of a property can be attributed to a Creator's content and/or a Realtor's distribution efforts, a Witness to Sale™ record is generated.

### 5.2 Attribution Rules

Attribution is determined by the following hierarchy:

| Scenario | Attribution | Commission Split |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Buyer engaged with one Creator's content only | Creator receives full attribution | Creator: 100% of commission pool |
| Buyer engaged with one Creator's content via a Realtor's link | Creator and Realtor share attribution | Creator: 70%, Realtor: 30% |
| MREN Media content distributed by a Realtor | MREN Media and Realtor share attribution | MREN Media: 50%, Realtor: 50% |
| Buyer came via Realtor link with no Creator content | Realtor receives full attribution | Realtor: 100% of commission pool |
| Super-Realtor created and distributed own content | Super-Realtor receives full attribution | Super-Realtor: 100% of commission pool |

### 5.3 Attribution Time Windows

| Window | Duration | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Attribution Cookie | 60 days | Period during which a buyer's interaction with a tracking link remains active for attribution purposes |
| Ledger Lock | 365 days | Period during which a recorded lead retains its attribution, even if the cookie has expired |

### 5.4 Immutability of Witness Records

Once a Witness to Sale™ record is generated, it is permanent and immutable. Records cannot be modified or deleted except by executive override with a mandatory audit log entry. This immutability protects all parties by ensuring that attribution cannot be retroactively altered.

### 5.5 Dispute Resolution

If you believe a Witness to Sale™ record contains an error in attribution, you may submit a dispute through the Platform. Disputes are reviewed by MREN administrators. During the dispute period, associated payouts are held in escrow. The administrator's determination is final, subject to the immutability doctrine.

---

## 6. Commission and Payments

### 6.1 Commission Pools

Property Developers set a commission pool percentage for each listed property within the following ranges:

| Property Type | Minimum | Maximum |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| House | 2% | 7% |
| Land | 5% | 17% |

The commission pool is calculated as a percentage of the property's listed sale price.

### 6.2 Commission Entitlement

Commission entitlements are generated when a Witness to Sale™ record is created following a confirmed sale. Entitlements are recorded on the Platform and represent an obligation of the Property Developer to pay the attributed parties.

### 6.3 Payout Process

In the current phase of the Platform, all payouts are processed manually. MREN records entitlements; actual fund transfers are facilitated through external banking channels. MREN does not hold funds in escrow or act as a payment intermediary.

### 6.4 Tax Obligations

Users are solely responsible for any tax obligations arising from income earned through the Platform, including but not limited to income tax, value-added tax (VAT), and withholding tax as applicable under Nigerian tax law. MREN does not provide tax advice and is not responsible for users' tax compliance.
